Comparing lossless image compressions for images and finding out the optimum algorithm for least encoding and decoding time 
We compare 3 algorithms namely Arithmetic Coding,LZW and Shannon Fano on various parameters like Compression Ratio,Encoding Time,Decoding Time and PSNR and try to find the benefits of each algorithm.
